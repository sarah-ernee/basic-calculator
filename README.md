## React Calculator
Basic calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of (positive and negative) integers as well as float points.

# Cloning & Navigation
1. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
2. Serve localhost with `npm start`.
   
- Codebase resides main in the src folder where `src/components` stores the React components. 

# Future Implementation
Some features that could be improved given more time would be the following:

1. Allow operations involving cosine, sine and tangent.
2. Memory storage of past calculations.
